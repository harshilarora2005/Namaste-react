# _Episode 02 - IGNITING OUR APP_

# 1. What is NPM?
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript. It helps developers manage and share code, install packages (libraries and frameworks), and handle dependencies in Node.js applications. NPM also includes a command-line interface (CLI) to manage those packages.

# 2. What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?
- **Parcel** and **Webpack** are module bundlers for JavaScript applications. They take all your files (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.), bundle them, and optimize them for the browser. 
- **Why we need it**: Bundlers allow developers to work with modularized code, improving maintainability and performance. They bundle and minify assets, manage dependencies, and ensure compatibility across different browsers.

# 3. What is `.parcel-cache`?
`.parcel-cache` is a directory created by Parcel to cache the result of previous builds. It helps speed up subsequent builds by reusing unchanged files and only processing modified ones.

# 4. What is `npx`?
`npx` is a command-line tool that comes with NPM. It allows you to execute packages without globally installing them. This is useful for running one-time scripts or using a tool without polluting your system with unnecessary dependencies.

# 5. What is the difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
- **dependencies**: These are packages required for your project to run in production.
- **devDependencies**: These are packages only needed during development (e.g., testing libraries, build tools) and are not required in the production environment.

# 6. What is Tree Shaking?
Tree Shaking is a feature that removes unused or dead code from the final JavaScript bundle. It helps reduce the size of the output file and improve load times by eliminating unnecessary code.

# 7. What is Hot Module Replacement?
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in bundlers like Webpack that allows developers to replace modules in a running application without reloading the entire page. This speeds up development by preserving the app's state while updating the code.

# 8. List down your favorite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.
1. **Zero Configuration**: Parcel requires no configuration to get started, unlike other bundlers like Webpack, which often require complex setup.
2. **Built-in HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**: It automatically updates modules in development without refreshing the page, preserving the application state.
3. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Parcel can automatically split code into smaller chunks, improving the loading performance of applications.
4. Caching for faster builds
5. Multi-language support

# 9. What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
`.gitignore` is a file that tells Git which files and directories to ignore in version control. 
- **What to add**: Build artifacts, log files, OS-specific files, node_modules, `.parcel-cache`, etc.
- **What not to add**: Source code, configuration files required to run the project, and any files essential for the build.

# 10. What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?
- **package.json**: It lists the project dependencies and their versions. It is used by NPM to identify the packages your project requires.
- **package-lock.json**: This file locks the exact version of each dependency and its sub-dependencies. It ensures that the project builds consistently across different environments.

# 11. Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
You should not modify `package-lock.json` because it is automatically generated and ensures consistent installs across all environments. Manual changes can introduce version conflicts or break builds.

# 12. What is `node_modules`? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
`node_modules` is a directory where NPM stores all the installed dependencies for your project. It is not a good idea to push it to Git because it is large and can be regenerated by running `npm install`.

# 13. What is the `dist` folder?
The `dist` (distribution) folder contains the production-ready files generated after the build process. These files are minified, optimized, and ready to be deployed.

# 14. What is `browserslist`?
`browserslist` is a tool used to specify which browsers your project supports. It helps tools like Babel and Autoprefixer to transpile code and add vendor prefixes for specified browsers.

# 15. Read about different bundlers: Vite, Webpack, Parcel
- **Vite**: A new build tool that offers fast development server start and optimized builds by leveraging native ES modules and using Rollup under the hood for production builds.
- **Webpack**: A widely used and highly configurable bundler that handles complex setups but requires more configuration.
- **Parcel**: Known for its zero-configuration approach, Parcel is simpler to use but still powerful.

# 16. Read about: ^ - caret and ~ - tilde
- **^ (caret)**: Allows updates to the most recent major version (e.g., ^1.2.3 allows 1.x.x but not 2.x.x).
- **~ (tilde)**: Allows updates to the most recent minor version (e.g., ~1.2.3 allows 1.2.x but not 1.3.x).

# 17. Read about Script types in HTML (MDN Docs)
HTML supports different types of scripts through the `type` attribute in the `<script>` tag. It specifies the scripting language. Examples include:
- **JavaScript (default)**: No `type` needed, 
```html
<script src="file.js"></script>.
```
- **Module**: For ES modules, use 
```html
<script type="module" src="module.js"></script>.
```
